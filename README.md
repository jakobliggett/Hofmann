# Hofmann
A simple java game engine designed to teach myself the basics of openGL.

# Testing the Engine
As of now all of the testing is contained in the testing subdirectory of the engine, as of the current verion a safe bet for demoing the engine is running the main method in the 'TestScene' class. Make sure you have lwjgl 3 linked as a library in order to build.
